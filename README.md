### Master Thesis â€“ Robust RL for Wireless Industrial Robotics
#### Title: Domain Randomization for Reinforcement Learning in Wireless Industrial Environments
Institution: Fraunhofer IPT, Aachen, Germany
Duration: March 2025 â€“ Present

#### Summary

This thesis explores how network impairments like latency, jitter, and packet loss in wireless industrial networks impact the performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents in mobile robotics.
To improve RL agent robustness in such environments, I developed a simulation framework that:
- Generates randomized shopfloor layouts to simulate real-world signal obstructions
- Integrates ROS 2 with NS-3 using a custom Tap Bridge interface for live IP-level communication
- Applies domain randomization to improve agent generalization under degraded network conditions
- Captures real-time network metrics (latency, jitter, packet loss) for training environment fidelity

#### Goal 
To train RL agents that are robust and reliable in dynamic, communication-challenged industrial settings.
