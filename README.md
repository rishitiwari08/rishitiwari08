### Master’s Thesis – Integration of Wireless Network Simulations into Robotics Simulation Frameworks  
**Institution:** Fraunhofer IPT, Aachen, Germany  
**Duration:** March 2025 – September 2025  

**Summary:**  
Developed a **co-simulation framework** integrating **ROS 2 / Gazebo** for robotic dynamics with **ns-3 (5G-LENA)** for realistic wireless networking.  
This framework enables the study of how **robot mobility interacts with wireless performance**, capturing key effects such as **latency, jitter, and handovers** in industrial environments.  

**Key Highlights:**  
-  Built a **TAP-bridge interface** for real-time ROS–ns3 communication  
-  Created a **procedural world generator** for randomized industrial layouts  
-  Mapped **coverage and latency heatmaps** across simulated shopfloors  
-  Established a **platform for communication-aware reinforcement learning**  

This research forms a foundation for **robust RL and connectivity-aware robotics**, supporting the next generation of **industrial 5G-enabled robots**.
